## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I would be analyzing the TMDb Movies dataset, which contains
information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movies Database (TMDb),
including user ratings and revenue. The dataset contains 10866 rows and 21
columns. The aim of this project is to derive interesting insights from the
dataset.
This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
